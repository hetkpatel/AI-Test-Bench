# AI Test Bench
Welcome to the AI Test Bench repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository serves as a playground for exploring and learning artificial intelligence through hands-on experimentation. The test bench includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks that implement various AI/ML architectures and techniques. Whether you're a beginner looking to dive into the world of AI or an experienced practitioner seeking a place to experiment, this repository is designed to encourage curiosity and hands-on exploration.

## Contents

The repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific machine learning architecture or concept. You'll find a diverse set of topics, including but not limited to:

- Multilayer Perceptron
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- *etc.*

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hetkpatel/AI-Test-Bench.git
```

2. Create virtual environment
```bash
$ python -m venv .
$ source ./bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Experiment and Play:** Feel free to modify the code, tweak parameters, and observe the impact on the results. The test bench is designed for hands-on learning, so don't hesitate to let your curiosity roam free!

## Note
Some code snippets might not work perfectly, and that's okay. The goal is to provide a reference and encourage experimentation.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration is key to enhancing the learning experience for everyone.

Happy learning and experimenting! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
